# Artifacts

The mysterious artifacts and their history is  shrouded in unknown. However, recently
acquired tomes and tablets have provided some details about their existance. Further
studies are necessary to determine the validity of these documents, but initial
investigations lean toward their validity.

Rumors have said there are 5-12 of these said artifacts, or shards, or gemstones. Not
much more is known, besides the fact that when united together again, they can provide
the weilder great power. As such, they were split up centuries, or even millenia ago
to prevent the speading powers of evil from laying hands on the collection of them.


## Artifacts

As further research will find, there are 10 separate artifacts hidden and buried
throughout Kendain. Whether they are hidden deep within ancient tombs for protection,
hidden behind numerous traps to test those worthy, or other trials to prove dedication
to good. Details are provided below for each artifact.
 

### Artifact of Divine Prediction

This artifact grants the user the ability to spend 10 minutes to ask a known god or
other deity a **yes** or **no** question, which it answers to its best ability.


### Artifact of Second Chances

This artifact grants the user an inspiration until the next dawn which they can use as
normal, however this inspiration is kept separate from the normal one (the user can
have both).


### Artifact of Grand Healing

This artifact when focused on during a short rest, grants the user and all others within
30 feet to forego rolling any hit dice spent during the short rest and regain the
maximum rollable value instead.


### Artifact of Arcane Rejuvenation

This artifact when focused on for 10 minutes provides the user the ability to regain
spent spell slots whose values total is equal to or less than half their character level
(i.e., level 7 druid can regain a 3rd level and 4th level spell slot, or 7 1st level slots).


### Artifact of Enhanced Focus

This artifact when focused on for 10 minutes provides the user a +1 to their proficiency
bonus until the next dawn.


### Artifact of Hidden Passage

This artifact provides the user the ability to use an action while possessing it to
become invisible for 1 hour. This ability can be used multiple times until the next
dawn. This allows multiple users to access the ability, as long as they possess the
artifact when attempting to use the action.


### Artifact of Assisted Flight

This artifact will transform into a magical carpet when the user speaks the command
word, using the statistics of a magic carpet. At the next dawn, the carpet returns
to artifact form. If in the air, it will slowing return to the ground (30 feet/second)
and then return to artifact form.


### Artifact of Temporary Longevity

This artifact grants the user and any other characters they wish within 30 feet to gain
temporary hits points equal to their Constitution modifier plus their character level.
These temporary hit points can last until the characters finish their next long rest.


### Artifact of Spiritual Rejuvenation

This artifact allows the user to cast the revivify spell. After completing the spell,
the artifact vanishes in a bright light and the artifact is transported to another
point on the same plane of existance it is used. Once used in this way, this artifact
will regain its charge in its new location, foregoing the recharge table mentioned in
[Using Artifacts](#using-artifacts).


### Artifact of Momentary Bolstering

This artifact provides the user the ability to attune to it, which provides them a
+1 bonus to an ability modifier of their choice until the next dawn.


## Using Artifacts

Each artifact will provide details on how to use its abilities, unless otherwise stating
taking an action to activate. Upon each artifacts usage, at the next dawn, it has the
possibility of regaining its charge. After being used, at the next dawn roll a d20 to
determine whether the artifact regains its charge for the day. The DC will be determined
by how many times the artifact has been used in the last five days. If this is the fifth
time in the last five days, the artifact will not regain its charge (DC 50). Otherwise,
use the table below.

| Uses in Previous 5 Days | DC to Regain Charge |
|:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 0 | 6 |
| 1 | 9 |
| 2 | 12 |
| 3 | 15 |
| 4 | 18 |
| 5 | 50 |
