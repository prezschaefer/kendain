### Elven Holy Ground

A farmer is complaining to anyone who listens that a group of elves has taken
his farm and land and kicked him off of it. He mentions he'll give as much as
he can, if the elves haven't already taken it all.

The elves are extremely hostile, believing that anyone who arrives will attempt
to take back "their" land. They will attack anyone who arrives on the territory.


### Clothes Shipment

The barmaid of **Gleaming Star Tavern**, [Mary Pleasant](../cities/orgis.md#mary-pleasant) 
will mention a recent raise in clothing prices as a result of the local tailor
having issues transporting a shipment of their clothes to the town southeast
of Orgis, [Aury](../cities/aury.md).

The owner of the tailor, [Fransico Porty](#../cities/orgis.md#fransico-porty),
had his last set of fine clothing raided on its way to [Aury](#../cities/aury.md)
and is looking for a group to escort his next shipment, as it costs a significant
amount of money. He is willing to pay **350 gp** for a successful delivery.

The clothes being delivered are worth nearly **100 pp** as the Lord's family
there has extremely fine tastes, but rarely leave Aury to purchase anything.
Reward is made when the clothes are delivered and payment received.


### River Salvage

A set of patrons are complaining about losing the cart of goods crossing the
river on the west side of town. They mention an accident spooking their horses
and causing the cart to fall over the side, floating down river a ways before
sinking. The two are merchants from [Ocray](../cities/ocray.md), west of town.
The pair is a blue female tiefling [Verin](../cities/ocray.md#verin) and a
female half-orc [Ilga](../cities/ocray.md#ilga), who own a shop there,
**Second Hand Treasures**.

After spending the rest of the day trying to find the cart, they had to give
up and are looking for help to recover whatever is possible. They offer
**100 gp** to help retrieve the contents of the cart.

The cart was carrying a few barrels of food, but the primary contents were
3 chests, containing fine jewels and golden and silver settings. The chests
contain around **750 gp** worth of materials they were transporting to sell.


### Cave Diving

Drunks are heard laughing and joking about a cave northeast of town which is
claimed to have a set of hidden treasure. However, no one ever returns from
from it alive. Rumors are that those who dare to go into the cave die or are
turned into monsters by some unknown evil. The drunks are two humans, Gary
and Lucas, both very intoxicated.

The drunks will provide a hand drawn map upon request of the cave's location,
however, the map is very poor, given how drunk the patrons are. The party will
have to spend time searching the area for the real location of the cave, or verify
the location when not drunk or find another patron familiar with the cave.
The cave is an entrance into the [Liteworth Cavern](../dungeons/liteworth_cavern.md)
dungeon, said to hold a treaure horde.


### Ale Run

The owner of the **Gleaming Star Tavern**, [Lyle Silvereyes](../cities/orgis.md#lyle-silvereyes),
has heard trouble with raids on the route to [Aury](../cities/aury.md) to get the
popular **Iams Aury Ale**. He is hoping to acquire **10 barrels** of the ale,
providing around **100 gp** (maybe **150 gp**) to acquire the barrels. He will
supply a wagon to bring them back, and will pay **200 gp** for delivering the
ale to him.
