### Orgis Elven Holy Ground

A farmer is complaining to anyone who listens that a group of elves has taken
his farm and land and kicked him off of it. He mentions he'll give as much as
he can, if the elves haven't already taken it all.

The elves are extremely hostile, believing that anyone who arrives will attempt
to take back "their" land. They will attack anyone who arrives on the territory.


### Orgis Clothes Shipment

The barmaid of **Gleaming Star Tavern**, [Mary Pleasant](../cities/orgis.md#mary-pleasant) 
will mention a recent raise in clothing prices as a result of the local tailor
having issues transporting a shipment of their clothes to the town southeast
of Orgis, [Aury](../cities/aury.md).

The owner of the tailor, [Fransico Porty](../cities/orgis.md#fransico-porty),
had his last set of fine clothing raided on its way to [Aury](../cities/aury.md)
and is looking for a group to escort his next shipment, as it costs a significant
amount of money. He is willing to pay **350 gp** for a successful delivery.

The clothes being delivered are worth nearly **100 pp** as the Lord's family
there has extremely fine tastes, but rarely leave Aury to purchase anything.
Reward is made when the clothes are delivered and payment received.


### Orgis River Salvage

A set of patrons are complaining about losing the cart of goods crossing the
river on the west side of town. They mention an accident spooking their horses
and causing the cart to fall over the side, floating down river a ways before
sinking. The two are merchants from [Ocray](../cities/ocray.md), west of town.
The pair is a blue female tiefling [Verin](../cities/ocray.md#verin) and a
female half-orc [Ilga](../cities/ocray.md#ilga), who own a shop there,
**Second Hand Treasures**.

After spending the rest of the day trying to find the cart, they had to give
up and are looking for help to recover whatever is possible. They offer
**100 gp** to help retrieve the contents of the cart.

The cart was carrying a few barrels of food, but the primary contents were
3 chests, containing fine jewels and golden and silver settings. The chests
contain around **750 gp** worth of materials they were transporting to sell.


### Orgis Cave Diving

Drunks are heard laughing and joking about a cave northeast of town which is
claimed to have a set of hidden treasure. However, no one ever returns from
from it alive. Rumors are that those who dare to go into the cave die or are
turned into monsters by some unknown evil. The drunks are two humans, Gary
and Lucas, both very intoxicated.

The drunks will provide a hand drawn map upon request of the cave's location,
however, the map is very poor, given how drunk the patrons are. The party will
have to spend time searching the area for the real location of the cave, or verify
the location when not drunk or find another patron familiar with the cave.
The cave is an entrance into the [Liteworth Cavern](../dungeons/liteworth_cavern.md)
dungeon, said to hold a treaure horde.


### Orgis Ale Run

The owner of the **Gleaming Star Tavern**, [Lyle Silvereyes](../cities/orgis.md#lyle-silvereyes),
has heard trouble with raids on the route to [Aury](../cities/aury.md) to get the
popular **Iams Aury Ale**. He is hoping to acquire **10 barrels** of the ale,
providing around **100 gp** (maybe **150 gp**) to acquire the barrels. He will
supply a wagon to bring them back, and will pay **200 gp** for delivering the
ale to him.


## Miers Tavern Quests

| Quest | Reward | Completed |
|:----- |:------:|:---------:|
| [Miers Bad Water](#miers-bad-water) | 300 gp | ---- |
| [Miers Sea Serpants](#miers-sea-serpants) | 500 gp | ---- |
| [Miers Tending Bar](#miers-tending-bar) | 10 gp / person / night | ---- |
| [Miers Harvesting Rice](#miers-harvesting-rice) | 5 gp / person / hour | ---- |


### Miers Bad Water

Some of the wells in town have been flagged for having tainted water and can no
longer be used. If the job goes on for a long time unfinished, it will affect
more and more wells in town as well.

Although magic can be used to supply and cleanse the water, it is only a
temporary solution. The party can journey down into the sewers to access the
area where the wells are supplied with water. They will find a series of
jellies and slimes that are tainting the water.

Clearing out these jellies and slimes will finally clean up the water and the
party will receive 300 gp as a reward.


### Miers Sea Serpants

A number of Giant Constrictor Snakes have been causing issues with travel
and recreation in the near next to Miers. The party can travel underwater
to find their nest, in an underwater cave in the river, and attempt to
clear them out.

There is no other method to get to the cave, beyond the underwater entrance.
The party will receive 500 gp for killing off the snakes, although there is
no known count. The party can receive more, if they can prove there are more
than the 2-3 that the city believes exist. The true number will depend on
the party's size and level.


### Miers Tending Bar

[Frank Turner](../cities/miers.md#frank-turner), owner of **Frank's Boar Inn**,
is looking for temporary help with some of his workers getting sick due to
the tainted water in town. He will pay workers 10 gp a night to help tend bar,
wait on tables, wash dishes, and cook. Possibly other things. Until a few
weeks after the water is cleaned up, when his normal workers get better and
can work once again.

If the party does well, he will continue to offer them gold to help. If they
do poorly he may find replacements for the party instead. If they do very
well, he may even offer them full time jobs, but they will need to be fully
available to work. No random work hours.


### Miers Harvesting Rice

Farmers south of town are having issues with their workers in town being
sick from the tainted water. As such, they are offering 5 gp per hour to help
harvest their rice crops. The rice needs to be harvested quickly, before it
also becomes tainted by any water from the city. If the party waits to long
to assist, most of the crops will be harvested or ruined.
