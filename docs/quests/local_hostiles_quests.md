### Local Bandits

A series of local bandits is robbing town. Areas can be requested from the town
guard. If the party wishes to search, they can ask, but will find little information
around. If the party waits in the area overnight, or patrols it, they have a chance
of running into one or more bandits, DC 18 encounter. The DC will decrease by 3
each night the party spends waiting.

If the party follows the bandit, they will be lead back to the hideout. An
interrigation or charm will also provide this information. If they fight or chase
the bandit (bandit is aware of the party), the bandit will lead them to a trap
or more bandits, or possibly a pungee pit.

The bandits that are provided to the town guard, in some form, will result in 10
gp per body.


### Bugbear Proximity

A set of bugbears has been seen nearby town, in the woods. The party can venture
out, after finding out more where they have been seen, or not. If the party
actively searches for the bugbears they can find them quickly, but will require
stealth checks if they wish to keep hidden. Otherwise, they can lay in wait but
will require longer to run into them.

The bugbears are scouting the town to find a way in the loot and steal what they
can. If the party is made aware of the bugbears, but ignore or choose not to do
anything within a week, the town will be attacked by the bugbears. This will
result in the town guard sending out a group to stop them, perhaps
[Kala Hanali](campaign_intro.md#kala-hanali) will recruit the party if they
still have good terms.

If the party ignores requests or isn't on good standing with Kala, the town
guard will attempt to stop the bugbears, with a DC 14 required to be successful.
On a failure, the town guards will offer double the reward, which will remain
until taken care of, for revenge sake.


### Giant Sewer Rats

The sewers have seen an overrun of giant rats. While not an issue at this time,
the town guard is offering a reward for killing as many as possible, 10 gp per
rat (whatever evidence is provided). There is no limit on this reward or quest,
beyond how many rats the party can successfully kill. The more time spent in
the sewers the more rats the party will encounter. An upper limit of 100 rats
is likely, but will depend on how much this system is abused.
