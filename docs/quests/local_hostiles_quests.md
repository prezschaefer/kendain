## Orgis Local Quests

| Quest | Reward | Completed |
|:----- |:------:|:---------:|
| [Orgis Local Bandits](#orgis-local-bandits) | 10 gp / head | ---- |
| [Orgis Bugbear Proximity](#orgis-bugbear-proximity) | 50 gp / head | ---- |
| [Orgis Giant Sewer Rats](#orgis-giant-sewer-rats) | 10 gp / head | Ongoing |


### Orgis Local Bandits

A series of local bandits is robbing town. Areas can be requested from the town
guard. If the party wishes to search, they can ask, but will find little information
around. If the party waits in the area overnight, or patrols it, they have a chance
of running into one or more bandits, DC 18 encounter. The DC will decrease by 3
each night the party spends waiting.

If the party follows the bandit, they will be lead back to the hideout. An
interrigation or charm will also provide this information. If they fight or chase
the bandit (bandit is aware of the party), the bandit will lead them to a trap
or more bandits, or possibly a pungee pit.

The bandits that are provided to the town guard, in some form, will result in 10
gp per body.


### Orgis Bugbear Proximity

A set of bugbears has been seen nearby town, in the woods. The party can venture
out, after finding out more where they have been seen, or not. If the party
actively searches for the bugbears they can find them quickly, but will require
stealth checks if they wish to keep hidden. Otherwise, they can lay in wait but
will require longer to run into them.

The bugbears are scouting the town to find a way in the loot and steal what they
can. If the party is made aware of the bugbears, but ignore or choose not to do
anything within a week, the town will be attacked by the bugbears. This will
result in the town guard sending out a group to stop them, perhaps
[Kala Hanali](campaign_intro.md#kala-hanali) will recruit the party if they
still have good terms.

If the party ignores requests or isn't on good standing with Kala, the town
guard will attempt to stop the bugbears, with a DC 14 required to be successful.
On a failure, the town guards will offer double the reward, which will remain
until taken care of, for revenge sake.


### Orgis Giant Sewer Rats

The sewers have seen an overrun of giant rats. While not an issue at this time,
the town guard is offering a reward for killing as many as possible, 10 gp per
rat (whatever evidence is provided). There is no limit on this reward or quest,
beyond how many rats the party can successfully kill. The more time spent in
the sewers the more rats the party will encounter. An upper limit of 100 rats
is likely, but will depend on how much this system is abused.


## Miers Local Quests

| Quest | Reward | Completed |
|:----- |:------:|:---------:|
| [Miers Giant Toads](#miers-giant-toads) | 50 gp / head | ---- |
| [Miers Sahuagin Cult](#miers-sahuagin-cult) | 100 gp / head | ---- |
| [Miers Huge Giant Crab](#miers-huge-giant-crab) | 2500 gp | ---- |
| [Miers Young Bronze Dragon](#miers-young-bronze-dragon) | Special | ---- |


### Miers Giant Toads

The typical underwater excursions in town are halted due to a large number
of Giant Toads that have recently plagued the the city and river. The city
will pay 50 gp per giant toad killed. A maximum of 50 giant toads are in
the area, but killing at least 20 is enough to allow the city to return to
normal underwater excursions.


### Miers Sahuagin Cult

A cult of Sahuagin's has been whispered around Miers. The city offers gold
for any helpful information on whether these rumors are true and even more
if they can be removed or destroyed. Once proof is provided about the cult,
in almost any form, the city will offer 100 gp for proof of each kill,
perhaps bonus once proof that they are gone/removed.

The party can talk to boat captains or crew for more information, or locals
traveling north, northwest of the town. The cult is hold up in a cave system
along the river north of town, main entrance is underwater and the cave
system has a few rooms that are flooded as well.

A secret entrance is available in the woods around the area, that no one
is aware and needs to be searched out.


### Miers Huge Giant Crab

A Huge GIant Crab is found to be in the river downstream of Miers (towards
ocean) and is causing trouble for ships traveling in the river. The city is
offering 2500 gp to remove the treat from the river and allow travel once again.


### Miers Young Bronze Dragon

A Young Bronze Dragon is rumored to be in a cave south of the town along the
river. No one knows anything more about that or where it really is, just
sights of a flying beast that glistens in the sun. People believe it's an
angel or metallic dragon.

[Lia Aloro](../cities/miers.md#lia-aloro) is the only person that knows more
about the dragon and is looking for a way to safely get a gem that she
believes it has. The gem is one of three that are used to help find the
[ancient artifact](../artifacts.md) hidden in or near
[Cort](../countries.md#cort).
