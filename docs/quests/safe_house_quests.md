# Safe House Quests

A series of quests and hook that involve the safe houses setup by
[Nicor Romas](campaign_intro.md#nicor-romas)
to investigate the [Mysterious Artifacts](quests/campaign_intro.md#mysterious_artifacts).

These are considered part of the main quest, as they will provide additional
information into the artifacts that will drive this campaign.

|:--------- |:------------:|
| [First Safe House](#first-safe-house) | Yes |
| [Hilly Hideaway](#hilly-hideaway) | Yes |
| [Swamp of Sorrow](#swamp-of-sorrow) | No |


## First Safe House

The first safe house is what drives the start of the campaign, and what provides
the party their binding experience. More details on this safe house can be found
in the [Campaign Infro](quests/campaign_intro.md#safe-house-quest). It provides
the first set of information about the
[Mysterious Artifacts](quests/campaign_intro.md#mysterious_artifacts).


## Hilly Hideaway

Second safe house that was hidden in the hills east of
[Orgis](../cities/orgis.md). A spell was cast the made the inside look empty,
but a panel in the back wall hide a secret room and deactivated the spell.

Among the encrypted documents found here, the party found a 1st level
"Compelled Duel" and "Create or Destroy Water", along with a 4th level
"Dimension Door" spell scrolls. They also found a Staff of the Python.


## Swamp of Sorrow

A safe house far out in the swamps west, northwest of [Miers](../cities/miers.md).
The safe house has some of the best details and content, all encrypted of course,
given it's location. The only entrance to the safe house is by using magical means.
The walls are coated to prevent damage resistance to almost everything.

The house can be destroyed with enough force, but the primary way to enter will
require transportation or some other means. This is way the house has been well
kept and still contains so much useful information and items.
