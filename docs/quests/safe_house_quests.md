# Safe House Quests

A series of quests and hook that involve the safe houses setup by
[Nicor Romas](quests/campaign_intro.md#nicor-romas)
to investigate the [Mysterious Artifacts](quests/campaign_intro.md#mysterious_artifacts).

These are considered part of the main quest, as they will provide additional
information into the artifacts that will drive this campaign.


## First Safe House

The first safe house is what drives the start of the campaign, and what provides
the party their binding experience. More details on this safe house can be found
in the [Campaign Infro](quests/campaign_intro.md#safe-house-quest). It provides
the first set of information about the
[Mysterious Artifacts](quests/campaign_intro.md#mysterious_artifacts).
