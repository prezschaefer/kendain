# Wilderness Quests

A series of quests and hooks that involve occurrances in the wilderness. This
can include random people ran into in the wilderness, happening upon the results
of something while traveling, etc. These will typically be side quests, providing
the party options, gold, items, and favors.

### Irrigation Digging

The party will find a family farm off the primary roads with a pleasant family of
humans just trying to make ends meet. The family consists of a father and mother
with 3 young girls. The father is trying to dig new irrigation trenches for their
crops, and is looking to pay for help. He is will to pay up to 10 gp per hour the
party spends digging trenches, up to 12 hours maximum.

The party will be required to make Athletics checks to determine how well they do,
whether the father is happy enough to pay well. Individual checks are very low, he
is just happy for help, at DC 8 Athletics. A majority of the party should pass for
all who help. If the party helps for more than 4 hours, Constitution checks are
required to continue the manual labor, DC 8 as well. If party members continue
after failing they take an exhaustion point for each failed check. The DC increases
by 2 every two hours, requiring a new check.

The family is happy to offer their barn for the party to stay for a nights rest, if
they stay the full 12 hours of work. If the party completes the project and passes
the majority of checks, they are offered dinner and the full 120 gp. If they fail
a majority of the Athletics checks, they get 50-80% of the possible offering.

There will be no combat encounters during this task, but a second pass through of
the area the party could be asked to help the family with a band of wolves,
details found in [Wolf Harassment](#wolf-harassment), taylored for this family.


### Wolf Harassment

A group of wolves have been harassing a family in the wilderness. The family
details are skim, but they do offer a reward for killing the two wolves that
they have seen and nearly been attacked by multiple times. There is a wolf den
nearby that can be tracked to, or they can simply wait the night for wolves to
arrive.

The family is offering 50 gp to assist, their life savings basically, but they
need their lives returned to them. The family is willing to trade for the wolf
pelts and bodies, if the party offers them, 4 wolves or more, giving the party
a magic item, that is a family heirloom.

If the party tracks the wolves to the den, they find another encounters worth,
and if they wish to investigate the den, they can find a small treasure horde.


### Bridge Building

A group of builders are attempting to build a new bridge across a river. The
river isn't dangerous, but is deep enough that normal crossing requires
traveling to the nearest bridges nearly hundreds of miles away. The builders
would allow help cutting down trees, cutting them up properly for the bridge,
laying them, and nailing and tying them, Athletics checks. Any help
identifying good trees (Nature checks), watching for attacks (Perception
checks), guiding animals to move trees (Animal Handling checks), and helping
collect food and hunt (Survial checks) will be appreciated.

After a weeks worth of help, the party will be paid 250 gp, with bonuses
offered for successful checks. Checks are performed once a day, with DC of
10, offering a 10 gp bonus. If the party leaves early, they will receive
20 gp per day they help, with bonuses they made.

Attacks by wildlife will be handled by encounter rolls once per day spent
at the builders camp. Re-rolling on the encounter table if it does make
sense against the buildes camp.


### Honey Foraging

A group of merchants is found out in the woods or on a trail. They are dressed
to protect themselves from bees, so they look interesting. They are looking for
assistance in collecting bee hives in the nearby forest. They are looking to
sell the honey for food and magical means.

If the party wishes to help, they will need to find a safe way to bring the hives
down. Climbing up and down is the best means, but chopping trees down will likely
cause the the hives to fall and break apart, ruining them. The merchants can
carry back up to 10 hives, offering 20 gp per intact hive (200 gp total).
If the party has poor handling checks with the hives, they will be attacked by
swarms of bees (swarms of wasps). Given the hives will be grouped close together,
it is likely the number of swarms could increase dramatically early on.

The hives are placed in secure boxes, where the merchants will handle the bees
safely. If handled carefully, the hives can be boxed without incident. Hives are
scattered across the forest, so typically they are found in 1-4 sets maximum.
It will take most of the day to complete this task to completion if desired.


### Balhannoth Hunting

A Balhannoth has been seen along the coastline near a city. This large monster
is extremely deadly. Two parties have already been sent to try to destroy it
and a majority of each were killed, unable to kill or drive the Balhannoth out.
The longer the party is aware of the creature and leaves it, the worth it's
affect on the nearby city, as it warps reality and will lay traps to fool
people into entering it's cave. It may even be able to create it's own lair if
enough time passes.

The party is sent by the nearby town's military force, with a large group of
mercenaries, as too many soliders have been lost now. The number of mercenaries
depends on the time before the party helps (party levels), as the longer it takes,
the less money and mercenaries the town can hire. One of the mercenaries is the
leader, being a little higher level. Initially, the mercenaries are made up of
"Experts" and a half-orc "East-Wing" as the leader. A majority of their abilities
are removed, simplifying combat, but the leader might have some left to help.

The town will pay more the longer it takes to respond, but again, the difficulty
goes up since not as many mercenaries will be hired due to the costs. The party
will also find a treasure trove when/if they defeat the Balhannoth, dependent on
their level and how many they must split their winnings/findings with.
