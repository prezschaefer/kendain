# Campaign Introduction: Gathering the Party

Plan to gather and unite the party together on their first quest together in the new campaign.


## Kala Hanali


### Background

A half-elf Paladin in heavy armor, will enter the tarvern where the current party members are,
and ask for assistance from the patrons there. The party members may be together or simply at
the tavern at the same time. He is one of the local lord's trusted personal guards, typically
known as the local "problem solver", but not in a negative murderous way. He uses persuasion
and non-agressive tactics to complete tasks. Those in his good side are treated exceptionally
well, and those against him are to a certain extent too.

Those extremely close to Kala will find out more of his history. A fallen paladin attempting
to redeem himself, trying to use non-agression to recover his position within the religious
community of Pelor. He will befriend those true to him and to good and justice. He is expected
to lead from the front and will likely become a reoccurring character and leader throughout the
campaign.


### Hook

Kala Hanali will ask for assistance from the patrens at the tavern in the name of the local
Lord, Lord Benedare. He mentions that assistance will be paid and volunteers may have a chance
to meet with him personally upon a successful quest. The quest is to locate some items at one of
the former magistrate's safe houses. Additional details will be provided in a more secure location,
although nothing is extremely secretive, simply the job should be completed prior to the information
getting out to the public.


## Nicor Romas

The former head magistrate, a tiefling sorcerer Nicor Romas, was found dead in this bed two weeks
ago, presumed of old age and/or bad health. A simple investigation found nothing that would lean
to nefarious activity. As part of typical magistrate work, a series of safe houses were setup in
the town and surrounding area for common uses by the local guards on patrols or quests, or as
part of undercover operations to catch criminals.

He was asked no long ago to begin investigating a series of tomes and tablets provided by Lord
Benedare. Nicor setup a series of research operations to try to investigate these items further
and learned they dealt with a series of tombs and possible artifacts long thought to be fiction.
These items have a lot of different contridicting references and beliefs, so no one knows for
sure what to believe, but this series of items may be the first set of real proof into them.


### Mysterious Artifacts

There are many names for these artifacts, each with similar promises/abilities, but with
different numbers and explanations depending on the tale. Such names as: "Gems of the Gods",
"Shards of the Hindale", "Stones of Earth, Time, Fire, and Shadow", and more. The only portion
of the story that seems to match across all accounts is that they can be used together to provide
great power, but in fear of evil hands welding them together, they were split across the world
and sealed in great temples to protect them until the world would need them again. All references
and information about these items has become fiction or lost, so now no one truly knows what
they are about or if they really exist. At least that is the common belief, there are also
conspiracies that certain clans or pacts know the real truth.


## Lord Benedare

Lord Benedare is a high elf, and has been the local lord for almost 10 years. He is known to be
just but very fair. A majority of the people he governs over accept him and trust him. There are
those who dislike some of his choices and him in general, but nothing serious. He recently lost
his head magistrate, Nicor Romas, after he died in his home just two weeks ago. He has yet to
appoint a new magistrate, and currently looks to Kala Hanali to take many tasks on for the
moment. The Lord will be kind and can be influenced easily by Kala since he trusts him so much.

He can take a liking to the party, using them for future work. If so, the party will have a
powerful ally in the region, and as long as they don't do anything illegal or evil, he will
continue to ask for their help and provide them support.

The research and paperwork the Lord is asking for help in collecting is about a series of ancient
tombs and artifacts thought to be only rumors and fiction. However, a recent discovery by Nicor
had found a series of tomes and tablets which may prove these tales to be true. Great riches
and power are thought to be located in these tombs, but again, that is truely unknown. The Lord
had asked Nicor to do his best in determining whether these finding could be proven and to
try to keep the information quiet until it could be properly reported to the primary governing
leaders. The tales are very contridictory and nothing is known for sure, so a great deal of
research is necessary to try to determine what portions of these tales are real, if any.


## Safe House Quest

If the party agrees to accompony Kala on the quest, he asks them to join him at the nearby guard
post in the morning, where he can provide additional details on the quest. He mentions they should
make sure to prepare for a 4-5 day mission, as the point of interest is far outside the city limits.

In the morning, at the guard post, the party is escorted to an office where Kala provides additional
details. Mainly that there is a valuable collection of paperwork and research items located at a
safe house far hidden within the wild. As the party may have heard, the former head magistrate passed
away, and after finally deciphering some of his notes, this became a high priority and was given
to Kala to seek out and collect these items immediately. Kala being short handed at the moment, spent
the night asking for adventureers to help escort him to recover these items at some of the popular
taverns commonly used by such adventureers.

As mentioned earlier, the party will be rewarded gold (80 gp per adventureer), and a face-to-face
meeting with Lord Benedear himself, after completing such an important task. Otherwise, if the party
needs any simple items for the quest, such as camping/travel items, rations, or other basic things,
they can be supplied and will be placed in a wagon they will travel with. If the party can
persuade Kala, Kala will also provide a 1d4 + 1 healing potions for the quest from his personal
supply of items.

Once ready, the party and Kala will set out for the safe house and expect the journey to take
about 2 days to reach the house. A majority of the trip will be on roads, but a major portion of
the second days travel will be off road, but may allow travel of the wagon for most of it, but not
all. The party will encounter at least one set of wild animals once off the road, but additional
random encounters may occur during these two days.

Upon reaching the safe house, they find it undisturbed, no sign of anything but being unkept for
about a month or so. No nefarious intentions within the house or area. The group will spend time
investigating the house, not finding the expected notes immediately or much or anything else
helpful. As they had reached the house near dark, they can stay at the home or leave if they wish.
If they stay overnight, which is what Kala would prefer, they can determine that the safe house has
a very high level illusionary spell cast upon part of the home, covering up a mechanism which opens
a secret series of rooms. Investigating these rooms, the party will find the paperwork and research
Kala was sent for. They will also find some magical items if they search well enough, possibly
finding a treasure horde. Kala will ask the party to collect the items and research so he can
deliver them back to the Lord (hinting that the magical items will be returned, not kept by the
party).

If the party causing a fuss or trying to keep the items or gold for themselves, Kala will try to
persuade them to honor the agreement of pay and meeting with the Lord, who may be more receptive
to requests now after finding this horde. Kala will keep track of how many "poor natured" or evil
attempts the party makes during the quest. If too many occur, and Kala cannot be persuaded by them
he will honor the agreements already made, but will not be interested in running into the party
in the future. If the party is honest and good natured, Kala will take a liking to the party and
upon the meeting with Lord Benedare, easily getting the party part of the treasure horde.

If the party leaves the house immediately, upon not finding the paperwork and research they are
attacked in the night. The group attacking them, goblins probably, had just beat them to sacking
the safe house, not really knowing what they had found when taking the paperwork and research.
If the party wins the fight, they can recover the backpacks and cases of paperwork and research,
along with possibly some shiny items, rolling on the individual treasure table 1d4 times to find
significantly less treasure, and a number of magic items 1d6 - 3 magic items on the bodies.

They can expect to run into another combat encounter the next day, traveling back to the main road,
but after that, the results of the random encounter table will occur on the travel back to town.
When they return, it will be the end of the day and Kala will have the party come with him back
to the guard post, ask them to turn over the collected items and research, if they haven't
already and then pay them the set amount, perhaps more if the party has done exceptionally well
and gained favor and impressed Kala, payment from his personal wealth. He will ask the party to
return here around 10am tomorrow and he will bring them before the Lord to meet with him.

Lord Benedare will thank the party for their help on retrieving these items. If Kala favors the
party, he will put in a great word for them and mention he paid them additionally for their great
work. The Lord will be more impressed by Kala and offer the party part of the found magic items,
their choice, or additional gold if they prefer.

The Lord will take note of their work, assisting Kala, and will mention they may be contacted
again in the future if more work is needed for future plot hooks. If the meeting goes well, he
will ask them to return later in the day, about another similar task to search another safe house
and collect anything that looks important to return back to the Lord. If the meeting is okay, he
may send out a runner the next day, if the party is still in town, to perform this task. If the
meeting goes poorly, he will most likely not ask for their services again, asking Kala to handle
things next time. Use the [safe house quests](quests/safe_house_quests.md) for the next possible quest.

If the meeting goes poorly, he will not ask for the party's services again, asking Kala to handle
things next time. If Kala is impressed with the party, he will most likely use the party again,
if possible. Kala will not ask for help with the remaining safe houses, but instead ask the party
to help clear out clans of criminals and hostile creatures around the area. Use the
[local hostiles quests](quests/local_hostile_quests.md).

Otherwise, if neither are impressed, this is the end of this arc with the Lord and Kala on a quest
basis. The party may "turn" on either which if caught will cause the party to be expelled, not
jailed or killed since they acquired the necessary information, unless things go very poorly.

The party can spend time spending their gold, acquiring more supplies, etc. in town before ending
the night. If the party stays in town at the tavern, they will be able to find a series of work
from offers or jobs by other patrens, see the document on [tavern quests](quests/tavern_quests.md).
If they leave town that night, they can choose where to go, rolling random encounters on their
travels until they arrive at the next town. If they spend a week in the wild, planning to travel to a
location significantly far away, see the document on [wilderness quests](quests/wilderness_quests.md).
