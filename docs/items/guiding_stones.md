# Guiding Stones

A set of 3 gemstones that when united, will lead to the temple
in or near [Cort](../countries.md#cort) that contains the
[ancient artifact](../artifact.md) hidden there.

| Gemstone | Location |
|:-------- |:-------- |
| [Ruby](#ruby-gemstone) | [Young Bronze Dragon](../quests/local_hostiles_quests.md#miers-young-bronze-dragon) |
| [Emerald](#emerald-gemstone) | forest dungeon east of [Lombleux](../cities/lombleux.md) |
| [Sapphire](#sapphire-gemstone) | [Lia Aloro](../cities/miers.md#lia-aloro) |


## Ruby Gemstone

The gemstone is currently held by a Young Bronze Dragon. The
dragon is near [Miers](../cities/miers.md) and only the mage
[Lia Aloro](../cities/miers.md#lia-aloro) is aware of the
dragon and the gemstone. She will send them on a
[quest](../quests/local_hostiles_quests.md#miers-young-bronze-dragon)
to collect it for her.


## Emerald Gemstone

The gemstone is currently in a lost city dungeon east of
[Lombleux](../cities/lombleux.md), deep within a forest. The
dungeon is dangerous and has kept away a majority of those from
disturbing the area.


## Sapphire Gemstone

The gemstone was collected from an underwater wreck of the east
coast of [Cort](../countries.md#cort). It is currently held by
[Lia Aloro](../cities/miers.md#lia-aloro), who has it hidden
away. She is looking for the other two.
