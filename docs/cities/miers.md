### Adanth

An overweight female halfling who runs **The Sphinx's Potions** shop, an
alchemy shop in Miers. She curiously inspects every coin that is paid to her.


### Alagar

A thin male blue tiefling who runs **Alagar's Wondrous Blades**, a weapon shop.
Alagar holds a strong grudge against goblins, even paying for proof that goblins
have been killed. He has been fooled in the past, so deceptions rolls of 20+ are
required when trying to deceive him with such proof.


### Athas Maerport

An elderly male elf who runs **Athas's Mystical Scriptorium**, a scribe shop.
He was a former adventurer, Wizard, but became cursed by the God of Trickery
and now spends his time working on spell scrolls to make a living.


### Bill

A stout male dwarf who runs **Bill's Goods**, a trading post. He checks each
of his sales with a ginger cat named Bali. Bali lived her former life as an
adventurer, who had fallen and was brought back by a drunken cleric who botched
the revivify ritual. Bill was one of Bali's party as well.


### Coelfre, The Fox

A practical male human, once known as The Fox, who runs **The Fox's Irons**,
an armory. He was cursed by a greedy merchant and can no longer see coins. He
only accepts trades of equipment and items because of this. His business is
down, due to this, but he has more items than usually too.


### Dashawny

A female gnome who runs **Dashawny's** shop, a weaponsmith. She was once an
adventurer, but after finding a fortune, retired to run a weaponsmith. Being
an artificer, she is able to use her knowledge and magic to craft great weapons.


### Elanor Loops

A crabby middle aged female human who runs **Below the Barrel**, a cheap inn.
She hates basically everyone and everything, which over the years have caused
the inn to become what it is, a hole in the wall. While prices are extremely
cheap to keep things going, it is certainly what you pay for, poor.


### Elrodrel Hvarn

A young male elf who runs **Elrodrel Hvarn**, a wandwright. He spent time
collecting magical items as a former adventurer, Druid, but later retired
to raise a family, marrying another druid human, Meghan, he was adventuring
with.


### Festi

A heavyset male dwarf who runs **Festi and Wisym's Oddities** shop, a
basic trading shop. He is a retired theif, keeping a fine steel dagger at his
belt. His true love, Wisym, died 12 years ago in a botched job and he gave
up to start this business after that.


### Frank Turner

An old male dwarf who runs **Frank's Boar Inn**, a moderate inn and stable.
He is reasonable and although his patrons range from all places and lives,
he usually keeps to himself.


### Frewyn

An old male halfling who runs **Frewyn and Artere's Hauberks** shop, an
armory. He is a cunning haggler who works with Artere, his older brother
who is responsible for making some fine armor.


### Hatae Gernvary

A middle aged male elf who runs the **Blue Oyster**, an upper class and
expensive inn and stable. Part of the family in control of the city, under
the graces of Lord Volpor due to his marriage to Dara Gernvary. Not necessarily
corrupt, but the Gernvary family certainly doesn't share their wealth back with
the community.


### Lia Aloro

A high level female drow mage who is looking into the
[ancient artifacts](../artifacts.md)
hidden across the land. She is willing to trade, trick, or kill for the
information.

She has made contact with the party, giving them 4000 gp and a magic item
for crypted papers from [Nicor Romas](orgis.md#nicor-romas).
The party gave her false papers, which she has now discovered and will use
the party as an expendable to collect what she needs and attempt to steal
or kill them next time.

Her next step is collecting the 3 gemstones that lead to the artifact hidden
in or near [Cort](../countries.md#cort). The
[Guiding Stones](../items/guiding_stones.md) have been mentioned in her
findings and she knows one is being kept by a dragon near
[Miers](miers.md) and will
[send the party](../quests/local_hostiles_quests.md#miers-young-bronze-dragon)
to go collect it.


### Lord Volpor

A middle aged human who rules Miers. He married Dara Gernvary, as part of a deal
with the Gernvary family, the richest in the area, to increase his wealth and
standing even further. Nothing appears nefarious about him, or his deeds. However,
there may be wrong doings under his watch, in his name, without his knowledge.
