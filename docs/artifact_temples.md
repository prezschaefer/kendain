# Artifact Temples

A series of temples spread across Kendain to hold and protect the series of
[artifacts](#artifacts.md). The temples were initially set up by those wishing
to protect evil, or others even, from reuniting the artifacts. However, some
temples were overtaken over the years by powerful evil beasts, drawn in by the
aura of power eminating from the artifacts within.

The temples are spread across all continents in Kendain, each containing one
of the 12 ancient artifacts. Although each was named long ago, the names are
not related to the artifact contained within.

## Temple of Saltwater Swamp

A temple hidden deep within a dangerous swamp on the northern tip of Cort,
northern country on Viseroth continent. A map will be necessary in order
to prevent those seeking to find this temple from becoming lost within the
swamp, or knowing the proper location (even if travels cannot become lost).


## Tree Grove Temple

Popularly known temple in the forst just south of Ulsangam, Kuraki, located
on the Viseroth continent. Although it is well known in the area, many don't
dare attempt to enter it, due to the large number of wild creatures that have
taken up residence in the temple.


## Temple of the Mountain Ridge

A temple located on a dangerous ridgeline in the mountain range north of
Menterra, Tormterra, located on the continent of Viseroth. The path towards
the temple is extremely dangerous, and large portions of it have been blocked
by rock slides, or simply fallen away. Great winds in the area prevent direct
flight to the temple, leaving the path as the best approach, even in its
terrible condition.


## Lava Crater Temple

An entrance to the temple is located in a crack within the crater in the
rolling hills north of Lan, Chipas, located on the Hinstro continent. The
crater itself used to contain lava, which has since cooled and hardened.
The crack leads down a dangerous path into a large cavern filled with hot
liquid lava. Travel is dangerous, due to the path condition itself and
the heat given off into the cavern by the lava. Long term exposure can
lead to damage and exhaustion.


## Moss Top Temple

A very old and worn set of ruins in open fields east of Begovech, Krichia,
located on the Hinstro continent. The ruins have survived well, for being
so directly in the open and the ongoing war between the Krichia and Chipas
countries. Hidden under large portions of fallen ruins is a moss covered
entrance to the temple below.


## Temple of the Shifting Sands

A portion of the temple is poking up from beneath the sands in the desert
east of Quistejos, in the unclaimed lands on the southwest coast of the
primary Artajia mainland. The temple has been buried by sand for most of
the recent times. Occassionally a portion of it is uncovered by the shifting
sand dunes in the desert. Trapped within it are some monsters, living off
other monsters that enter via digging and burrowing in the sand.


## Rock Island Temple

A rock hardened, storm worn temple on the island southeast of Artaja,
Artajia on the southern island of Artajia. Most of the island is worn
jutting rocks, uninhabittable by civilized peoples, but shelter to
numerous creatures in the worn caverns. The entire island is deemed too
dangerous for travel or living and the temple has never been fully
explored.


## Overgrown Temple

Deep in jungle overgrowth east of Hutio, in the western province of Kamaa
on the Canderan continent lies this temple. Another temple which requires
a map or guide in order to prevent getting lost and simply finding the
temple buried within the jungle and hidden under massive nature growth.


## Snow Sharp Temple

A snow covered and surrounded temple near the summit of one of the
mountains in the range west of Hetarian, Ruoia, on the Canderan continent.
Over time glaciers and snow have shifted around the temple, hiding it
for quite some time. The subzero temperatures make it difficult to reach,
and the lack of safe areas nearby prevent further exploration.


## Freshwater Deep Temple

A temple near the bottom of the lake next to Hape, in the eastern province
of Kamaa on the Canderan continent. The temple is all below water, but
portions of it have trapped air within it. Tales tell of its existance,
but most people don't dare attempt to enter it, not knowing what will be
found within.


## Temple of Absent Light

A temple is located on the uninhabited and unclaimed land on the peninsula
located in south Tioteva on the Canderan continent. The entire area is
cursed to contain no sources of light and is cast in darkness at all times.
The further into the area, the darker it becomes, which is where the
temple is located. Although crafted light (torches) work initially to
provide some light, further in even torches do not help. Magically light
lasts longer, but even the most powerful magic is unable to penetrate the
darkness long enough to make it to the rumored temple. Almost as if the
temple is the source of this darkness.


## Temple of Deep Grave

A temple is buried deep within the earth. An old silver mine shaft provides
entrance to the area where the temple was found. However, once the miners
found this temple, a string of monsters and terrible accidents (curses)
caused the miners to abandon the mine and close it. Almost all who enter
never return or return barely alive after making it almost nowhere into the
mine.
